#Augmented Reality Card Game
###Mixed Reality and Tangible Interfaces project
#####By Mattia Chenet

Our project models a new way of playing card game with augmented reality.

Thanks to special markers found in the magazine and an application installed on your smartphone, itâ€™s possible to play like in a YU-GI-OH cartoon.
